# AI-Driven-Solution-for-Code-Compliance
 to create an AI-driven solution that allows users to upload an address and specify the type of project, subsequently generating code compliance for that address and type of project.. The ideal candidate should have experience in AI development, web integration, and a solid understanding of coding regulations. Your expertise will be crucial in building a user-friendly platform that streamlines the compliance process that i can integrate onto my go high level website. If you have a passion for innovative technology and a background in code compliance, we would love to hear from you!
==============
Creating an AI-driven solution for code compliance based on project type and address requires several components, including address parsing, project categorization, compliance code retrieval, and a user interface for uploading and querying data. Below is an outline of the solution along with a Python-based implementation for the backend. This code can integrate with a frontend system such as GoHighLevel via APIs.
Solution Architecture

    Frontend Integration:
        Users upload the address and project type via a web form.
        The input is sent to the backend API for processing.

    Backend Components:
        Address Parsing: Use APIs like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap to validate and normalize the address.
        Project Type Handling: Categorize the project and match it to relevant codes.
        Compliance Code Retrieval: AI model or database to match project types and address jurisdictions with compliance codes.
        Response Generation: Return detailed compliance requirements.

    Database:
        Store compliance regulations, categorized by jurisdiction and project type.

    AI Integration:
        Train a model or use a rules-based system to handle ambiguities in project descriptions and address mappings.

    API Design:
        Create endpoints to process user queries and return results.

Python Code
Prerequisites

    Install necessary libraries:

    pip install flask openai requests pandas

Implementation

import requests

# Flask app

# Set your OpenAI API key

        "California": "Follow Title 24 - Residential Standards",
    },
    "commercial": {
        "New York": "Follow NYC Building Code - Commercial Section",
        "California": "Follow California Building Standards Code",
    },
}

    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        if data["results"]:
            return data["results"][0]["formatted_address"], data["results"][0]["address_components"]
    return None, None

# Compliance lookup

    return COMPLIANCE_DATA.get(project_type, {}).get(jurisdiction, "No compliance code found for this project type and location.")

Key Features

    Address Validation: Uses Google Maps API to normalize and validate the address.
    Project Type Handling: Matches project type with predefined compliance regulations.
    AI Integration: Uses OpenAI to generate detailed and nuanced compliance suggestions.
    Scalable Design: Supports integration with a more extensive database or external APIs.

Integration with GoHighLevel

    Deploy the Python backend using a service like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
    Create an API endpoint in GoHighLevel to connect to the backend.
    Use the GoHighLevel webhook feature to send address and project type inputs to the backend API.
    Display the results returned from the API in the user dashboard.

Future Enhancements

    Dynamic Compliance Data: Replace the static compliance dictionary with a database or API.
    User Feedback Loop: Allow users to flag incorrect results, improving future outputs.
    Interactive Reports: Generate PDF or HTML reports summarizing compliance requirements.
